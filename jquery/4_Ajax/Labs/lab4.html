			Use jQuery to complete an Ajax-based employee editing application.  
			
			The basic steps are:
			
			(1) Make an Ajax request to employeeselectlist.php, which returns 
				HTML code for a select list showing the employees by name.  The 
				list should be displayed in the div with the id employees.
				
			(2) Rig the select list so that when the value changes, a POST
				request to employeeeditform.php, passing the employee's ID 
				number as a parameter called id.  The script will return a 
				fragment of HTML that creates a short form where edits can 
				be made.  This form should be displayed in the div with the 
				id editingForm.
				
			(3) Rig the text fields in the edit form so that a change to any 
				of them	initiates a POST request to employeeupdate.php, 
				passing it 3 parameters: id, field, and newValue.  The 
				script uses these parameters to build and execute an 
				UPDATE query.
				
			(4) If the update succeeds, display an appropriate message in the
				div with the id updateMessage and then fade the message out 
				over several seconds.
				
				Also, since a first or last name may have been updated, you 
				should also	update the select list in the div with the id 
				employees.  
				
				If the query fails, just display an message to that effect 
				and then fade it out.
