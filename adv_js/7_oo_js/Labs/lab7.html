		<title>Lab 7: Creating a JavaScript Object Class</title>
		<script type="text/javascript">

		/*

		Of course, JavaScript object classes are used to do more useful things than to 
		create virtual domestic or farm animals.  They are typically used to contain data
		about a particular entity and to provide an interface to working with that data
		(a notion called encapsulation).
		
		For this lab, create a constructor function for an object class called Employee.
		At minimum, an instance from this class should accommodate the following
		properties: first name, last name, job title, salary and status (employed, fired,
		retired, etc).  You should also define the following instance methods:
		
		fire() - sets employee's status to terminated
		retire() - sets employee's status to retired
		giveRaise() - accepts a percentage (ex: 0.04) and increases the employees salary
		by that amount
		
		For each method, be sure to display a short message to verify that the targeted
		property has been changed.  Then create several instances and test your interface.
