		<title>Using Regular Expressions to Standardize a Data Format</title>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			
			/*
			
			One source of developer (and database administrator) frustration occurs
			when end users use a variety of formats to enter data that should be in
			a standard format.  For example, one user may enter her home value as
			$575,500.00 while another may enter his as 627750.  You can help alleviate 
			this problem using regular expressions, backreferences and JavaScript
			string methods.
			
			For this lab, complete the formatPhone function called by a click on the
			button below.  Your function should accept the text field object being passed
			and check the value of the field against a regular expression that allows 
			some flexibility in how the phone number is entered.  Try to make your
			regular expression accommodate the following:
			
			  1.  Area code with or without parentheses
			  2.  Area code's first digit cannot be 0 or 1.
			  3.  Groups of numbers can be separated by a space, a dash or a period.
			  4.  Separator character between groups is optional
			  
			If the data entered matches your regular expression, use the expression
			together with the JavaScript replace() method to reformat the phone
			number in the field into the following format:  ###-###-###
			
			If the data entered does not match, be sure to let the user know and
			clear out the field so a new number can be entered.
			
			*/
			
			// Backreferences
			// var phoneCandidate = window.prompt("Please enter your Phone Number:", "");

			// Set up the regular expressions
			// var reSSN = /^\d{3}[\- ]?\d{2}[\- ]?\d{4}$/;
			
			var rePhone = /^\(?([2-9]\d{2})\)?[\-\. ]?([2-9]\d{2})[\-\. ]?(\d{4})$/;

			function formatPhone (phoneField) {
				if (rePhone.test(phoneField.value)) {
					phoneField.value = phoneField.value.replace(rePhone, "$1-$2-$3");
				} else {
					alert("Invalid phone number, try again!");
					phoneField.value = "";
				}
			}
